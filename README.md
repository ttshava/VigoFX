# VigoFX
Vigo FX is a rotating savings and credit platform for a group of people who know one another

The members of the group contribute an agreed-upon amount of money to a pool that is then given to one of the members.

Its a way for participants to get an interest-free loan or force themselves to save money, perhaps for a large purchase.
